Hugo ships with a large number of configuration directives.
The config directory is where those directives are stored as JSON, YAML, or TOML files.
Every root setting object can stand as its own file and structured by environments.
Projects with minimal settings and no need for environment awareness can use a single config.toml file at its root.

Many sites may need little to no configuration, but Hugo ships with a large number of configuration directives for more granular directions on how you want Hugo to build your website.
Note: config directory is not created by default.
